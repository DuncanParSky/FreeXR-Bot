Dump SystemUX tutorial
---
Run the following command to dump SystemUX from your device:
```console
adb pull /system_ext/priv-app/SystemUX/SystemUX.apk
```
This copies the APK to the current directory the shell is in. You can use a fancy APK viewer to look into it or just rename extension to `.zip` to open it up.
