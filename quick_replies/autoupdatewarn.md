Warns about Meta potentially auto-updating headsets
---
Affects: **Hollywood, Eureka**
There have been some reports of Quests autoupdating to latest server even with updates disabled through the command. While this may not be true that Meta is force pushing updates, I **highly recommend disabling Wi-Fi (turning off in UI should be sufficient)** until we confirm and find a way to disable the headset talking to Meta's servers. 
We will be looking into this.
